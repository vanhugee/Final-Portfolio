									<p>Design is about far more than aesthetics—it’s about creating solutions that have a meaningful impact on people’s lives. In a world that grows more complex every day, design must move beyond surface-level visuals to address real human needs in ways that are functional, accessible, and intuitive. As a computer science student, I’ve realized that the most groundbreaking solutions don’t come solely from technological advancements, but from a deep understanding of human behavior and experience. Through my journey in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), I’ve immersed myself in interviewing users, observing how people engage with technology, and challenging my own preconceived notions about design.</p>
									<p>
										This manifesto represents my design philosophy—rooted in empathy, driven by inclusivity, refined through iteration, and focused on reducing complexity. By adhering to these core principles, I strive to create user-centered designs that not only improve people’s lives but also elevate the way they interact with technology.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Design Through Experimentation</h3>
									<p>The design process is inherently non-linear. In "The Design of Everyday Things", Don Norman introduces the Iterative Cycle of Human-Centered Design: observe the target population, generate ideas, produce prototypes, and test them—repeating the process until the design is refined. In our case, our most significant breakthroughs didn’t come from polished initial concepts but rather from rapid prototyping, which quickly revealed underlying flaws and areas for improvement.</p>

									</figure>
									<p>
										In our Redesign Sprint, we initially developed a digital visualization we believed was
										effective. However, when we applied usability testing as our core methodology—having users
										complete tasks and answer questions while interacting with our visualizations—we uncovered issues
										we hadn’t anticipated. Users consistently struggled with aspects of the interface,
										particularly features like bubble chart transparency, legend interactions, and graph interpretation,
										which were more complex and less intuitive than we had thought.
									</p>
									<p>
										Armed with these insights, we refined our approach, introducing clearer labeling, higher contrast, and Braille for added accessibility in our redesigned physical prototypes. But we didn't stop there. We ran additional usability tests with the new prototypes, which were better received but still revealed areas for future improvement. This iterative process highlighted the importance of continual feedback and intelligent adaptation.

								<h3 class="major">Design for All</h3>
								<p>Accessibility isn't a feature to be tacked on at the end of the design process—it’s the foundation of meaningful design. Designing for extreme use cases doesn't limit possibilities; it expands them. When we design for users with the most challenging interactions, we create technologies that are more adaptable, intuitive, and ultimately more human.
								</p>
								<p>
									While accessibility is often seen as addressing "extreme" use cases, it’s actually far more common than we realize. In the U.S., more than 1 in 4 adults (28.7%) have some form of disability, and 12.2% have mobility-related disabilities, facing challenges like difficulty walking or climbing stairs. This is precisely where technology should step in to help.

									In one project, I took on a 24-hour challenge to navigate Davidson College exclusively using handicap-accessible routes. I also created annotated campus maps, highlighting well-designed, accessible areas that accommodate individuals with mobility challenges, as well as areas where accessibility falls short and creates barriers for those who rely on mobility aids.

								</p>
								<p>
									Through this experience, I realized how easy it is to overlook design difficulties if we don’t share the same challenges. As a student, I had taken for granted how effortlessly I could navigate campus without considering the obstacles others might face. This discovery reinforced my belief that, as designers, we must go out of our way to ensure our designs are as inclusive and accessible as possible to a wide range of users.
								</p>



									<h3 class="major">Design Through Empathy</h3>
									<p>Human-centered design, as the name suggests, places humans at the core of the design process. To design for people effectively, it’s essential to deeply understand their expectations, concerns, and motivations in order to create something that truly satisfies their needs. A critical part of this process is empathy. Empathy in design isn't just a passive feeling—it's an active, rigorous approach to understanding human experiences at their most nuanced and personal levels.</p>
									<p>Throughout our design sprints, I learned that genuine user understanding goes far beyond surface-level interviews or demographic data. It requires a deep commitment to seeing the world from another’s perspective. Empathy manifests in many ways. For example, when interviewing users, it’s important to enter without preconceived notions and avoid finishing their sentences. It’s about seeing their problems through their own lens and understanding their reasoning, emotions, and motivations. At the most basic level, empathy involves creating a comfortable space for interviewees, removing any power dynamics, and allowing them to share their true thoughts and experiences.
									</p>

										<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">Bryan’s Post Interview Empathy Map
										</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>
									In my first project, which involved need-finding for a nutritional tracking app, I conducted three interviews. One of my interviewees was Bryan, a 22-year-old first-year PhD student at MIT. Bryan had very different views on dining and nutrition compared to my own. Rather than sticking to my prepared questions, I focused on digging deeper with follow-up questions that centered on the "why" behind his perspectives. It would have been easy to make assumptions, but I learned that it’s crucial to refrain from doing so and instead view things from the user’s perspective. To further aid in this, I constructed an empathy map to visualize users’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors—an invaluable tool in aligning our design decisions with real user needs.
								</p>

									<p>This experience taught me that empathy is not just a consideration but a powerful methodology that shapes meaningful and effective designs.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Design For Minimal Mental Effort</h3>
									<p>What I've discovered in my work so far is that one of the biggest design challenges isn’t adding features—it’s removing friction. Cognitive load—the mental effort required to navigate a system—is the silent killer of user experience. Every unnecessary tap, confusing icon, or moment of hesitation drains the user’s limited mental resources.</p>
									<p>We've all encountered designs so cluttered with details that the important information gets lost. When we revisited our bubble chart visualizations in the movie comparison project, a consistent complaint from user testers was that there was simply too much information. This overload made it difficult for users to find the specific data they needed, turning the interface into a perfect example of "knowledge in the world" versus "knowledge in the head." Our design forced users to remember too much, creating an unnecessary cognitive burden.
									</p>
									<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
										<img src="images/movie_bubble.webp" alt="Mental_Effort" style="border-radius: 8px; width: 100%;">
										<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">Old Bubble Chart Visualization</figcaption>
										</figcaption>
								</figure>
									<p>
										During our redesign sprint, we took a different approach. Although we weren't using the exact same graph, we focused on simplicity for the new visualizations. We stripped down the interface to its essential elements, emphasizing clarity through better labeling. This shift toward minimalism allowed us to prioritize what mattered most, reducing cognitive load and improving overall usability.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Sensory-Driven Design</h3>
									<p>
										In my previous point, I emphasized the importance of minimizing cognitive load in design to avoid overwhelming users and diluting key messages. However, I've come to realize that while simplicity is essential, integrating multiple sensory inputs across a design can significantly enhance user experience. Design communication isn't limited to visual interfaces—effective solutions should engage multiple sensory channels to deepen understanding and interaction.
									</p>
									<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
										<img src="images/multi_sensory.jpg" alt="Multisensory" style="border-radius: 8px; width: 100%;">
										<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">The Five Human Senses</figcaption>
										</figcaption>
								</figure>

									<p>
										Throughout our design sprints, particularly the “Re-design and Extend” Sprint, we learned that information is processed most effectively when multiple senses are engaged. For instance, in our "Design for Understanding" sprint, we initially focused solely on visual representations in our visualizations. However, usability testing revealed significant flaws—users often missed the main points or failed to fully grasp the designs.
									</p>
									<p>
										Thus, in our subsequent redesign sprint, my team and I addressed this by incorporating a multisensory approach. We created physical prototypes that combined auditory, visual, and tactile elements, allowing us to explore how information could be conveyed through different sensory modalities. This approach resulted in more immersive experiences for users, reinforcing the idea that when we design for multiple senses, we create more dynamic and effective solutions.
									</p>
									<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
										<img src="images/user_testing.webp" alt="User_Testing" style="border-radius: 8px; width: 100%;">
										<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">Usability Testing with Davidson Students</figcaption>
										</figcaption>
								</figure>
									<p>
										Ultimately, these experiences have shown me that designs are most impactful when they engage multiple senses, creating layered interactions that better convey information. It's crucial to think beyond visuals and integrate elements that appeal to several sensory modalities for a richer, more intuitive user experience.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>
										Each principle we've explored—from radical empathy to multisensory design, from cognitive simplicity to accessibility—represents a different lens through which we can approach technological innovation. These are not isolated strategies, but interconnected approaches that collectively transform how we think about design.
									</p>
									<p>
										Design is never a destination—it's an ongoing conversation. As we move forward, the most exciting design challenges won't be solved by technological sophistication alone, but by our ability to listen, to empathize, and to imagine new possibilities. Design is an act of hope—a continuous process of creating tools that expand human potential.
